Network: FRC Teams and matches (Qual and Elim) with other teams

Use Blue Alliance and standard API... can get data in a great json file for easy usage...

Current thought is a uniderectional graph with each team being connected unidirectionally with +score to alliance partners and -score to their oponents for every match...

Theoretically could do with just a single event (champs) or could do with full season... or even multiple seasons... depends on how easy it ends up being
