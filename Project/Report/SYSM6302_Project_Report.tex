\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
	In this project multiple networks will be created and analyzed on match data between FRC teams for various years of competition. In each network graph, a team will be represented by nodes and individual matches will be included as edges. 
\end{abstract}

\section{Dataset}
The data for this project is match data for multiple years (1992-2021)  of FRC competition matches. Specifically, the match specific data for the 2003-2019 seasons 
will be analyzed since enough data is available for each season. Additionally, the 2013-2020 seasons specifically were analyzed as these are the years I personally have been involved in.

The data was obtained from The Blue Alliance https://www.thebluealliance.com/

\section{Network Construction}

%\section{Graph Structure}
%A different graph will be constructed for each year of competition. This will consist of all the teams competing (nodes) and the matches that are played (edges). Since multiple edges may be connected between nodes so this will be constructed as a multi-graph and include important information about teams and each match.\\
%
%Each node represents a team and will be encoded with the team number and other attributes, such as the competitions that were competed in or the number of awards won.\\
%
%Each edge will be encoded with match information, such as if teams were alliance partners or opponents, qualification or elimination matches, and the event it occurred at.
%
%\section{Analysis}
%From these graphs various centrality metrics and graph properties for different match attributes will be analyzed. Specifically, individual graphs that represent different match characteristics between teams will be created to analyze traditional using traditional methods. Additionally, custom centrality metrics (and more complicated diameter/cutset calculations) will be used to analyze each year with more metrics that easier to compare.
