Although I don't know much about FIFA (I'm definetly an Americain Football guy), I expect their to be more connections between countries in the same regions then with teams on different parts of the world, so this would make sence for it to be more assortative. On the other hand, the classes of importers and exporters doesn't seem to have any particular reason for interconnection between thoose in the same group (considering the definition of an import/export) so disassortative mixing is the result."
